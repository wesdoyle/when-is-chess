# when-is-chess

This app outputs chess events for the current month at public Libaries in Madison.
Requires an internet connection to scan the public library calendar.

Requests are cached using local file storage for 24 hours. The library website is pretty slow, so the first request takes up to 10 seconds.

`python when-is-chess.py`

Alias in `~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc` etc. for quick lookup.
